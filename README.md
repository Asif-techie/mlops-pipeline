# End-to-End-ML-Model-Development

Production-ready ML workflow with EDA, feature engineering, model development and FastAPI deployment.

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains a production-ready MLOps pipeline that covers the full lifecycle of a supervised ML project:

- **Data acquisition & cleaning**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and visualizations
- **Feature engineering & preprocessing**
- **Model training, evaluation & experiment tracking** (MLflow)
- **Model packaging & containerization**
- **FastAPI service for model inference**
- **CI/CD workflows for automated testing & deployment**
- **Monitoring & logging**

This repo is intended as a template to replicate end-to-end workflows and best practices for deploying ML systems.
